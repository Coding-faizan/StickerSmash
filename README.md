## Build a Screen Summary

- before coding the UI, break down it into components from the given ui i.e: design or Image
- React Native includes a few different components for handling touch events, but <Pressable> is recommended for its flexibility. It can detect single taps, long presses, trigger separate events when the button is pushed in and released, and more.
